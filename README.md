Hi, I’m @F81nj3ct0r!

- I have an interest in computers and all things related to them. I have had computers around me my whole life and I have come to love them and finding out everything that can be
  done with computers... Inevitably, this passion led to me pursue a career cyber security (because when testing what can be done, what better place to do it then with security?).

- I am currently working towards a Bachelors of Science in Cyber Security from MSU Denver with hopes of graduating in May 2023.

- I’m looking to collaborate on anything you would like to work with me on or even just think is interesting! I love anything computer related, but security programs (or better
  yet, programs to evade/exploit them!) are what really get me going. I love Pentesting and desire to work for the US government someday helping protect the cyber-infrastructure
  of our world.

Happy Hacking!
